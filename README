A python3 wrapper for ffmpeg. Focused on scripting video file conversions.

This wrapper helps parse information about media files with ffprobe, and does it's transcoding
through ffmpeg. 

Currently has strong support for:
  Stream metadata and analysis
  Converting files progmattically
  Snipping clips out of video files
  Concatenating video files
  Saving HLS streams to disk

Look through the pympeg_examples.py, tools.py, and some of the scripts for pragmatic examples of varying complexities.

FFMPEG needs to be installed and in your PATH, non-free codecs ARE supported, so have fun.
