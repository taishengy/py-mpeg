A python3 wrapper for ffmpeg. Focused on scripting video file conversions.

This wrapper helps parse information about media files with ffprobe, and does it's transcoding
through ffmpeg. Look through the examples file to see what's possible. Don't expect it to be 
particularily pythonic.

FFMPEG needs to be installed, building itself with non-free codecs is recommended.
