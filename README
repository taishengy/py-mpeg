A python3 wrapper for ffmpeg. Focused on scripting video file conversions.

This wrapper helps parse information about media files with ffprobe, and does it's transcoding
through ffmpeg.

Currently has strong support for:
  Stream metadata and analysis
  Converting files to new formats/encodings
    Audio: aac (aac and libaac_fdk), mp3 (libmp3lame), flac, opus, vorbis, and copy
    Video: x264, x265, vp8, vp9, and copy
    Stream exclusion
  Snipping clips out of video files
    Clipped segments can be encoded with any encoder or stream copied
  Concatenating video files
    Tested with h264 formats and HLS .ts streams
  Saving HLS and other network streams to disk
    See streamsaver.py, well tested but no examples are included here

Several helper functions for converting whole directories of video files, time code manipulation, path name
manipulation/listing and the like are included from the get go.

Look through the pympeg_examples.py, tools.py, and some of the scripts for pragmatic examples of varying complexities.

FFMPEG needs to be installed and in your PATH, non-free codecs ARE supported, so have fun.
